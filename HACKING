Building the code
-----------------

The list of packages required to build mediascanner can be found in
the Build-Depends stanza of the debian/control.in file.  In addition
to those packages, you should install "qt5-default" to ensure that the
Qt 5.x versions of build tools are used in preference to the Qt 4.x
versions.

The software can then be built with the following commands:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

The tests can then be run using:

    $ make test

Note that "make test" will not trigger a rebuild, so it is necessary
to rerun "make" first if any code has been changed.
